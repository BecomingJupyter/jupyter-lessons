    "\n",
    "4.1 Wildcards\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The * wildcard\n",
    "The character * is called a wildcard, and will match against none or more character(s) in a file (or directory) name. For example, in your unixstuff directory, type\n",
    "\n",
    "% ls list*\n",
    "\n",
    "This will list all files in the current directory starting with list....\n",
    "\n",
    "Try typing\n",
    "\n",
    "% ls *list\n",
    "\n",
    "This will list all files in the current directory ending with ....list\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "4.2 Filename conventions\n",
    "We should note here that a directory is merely a special type of file. So the rules and conventions for naming files apply also to directories.\n",
    "\n",
    "In naming files, characters with special meanings such as / * & % , should be avoided. Also, avoid using spaces within names. The safest way to name a file is to use only alphanumeric characters, that is, letters and numbers, together with _ (underscore) and . (dot).\n",
    "\n",
    "Good filenames\tBad filenames\n",
    "project.txt\tproject\n",
    "my_big_program.c\tmy big program.c\n",
    "fred_dave.doc\tfred & dave.doc\n",
    "File names conventionally start with a lower-case letter, and may end with a dot followed by a group of letters indicating the contents of the file. For example, all files consisting of C code may be named with the ending .c, for example, prog1.c . Then in order to list all files containing C code in your home directory, you need only type ls *.c in that directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.3 Getting Help\n",
    "On-line Manuals\n",
    "There are on-line manuals which gives information about most commands. The manual pages tell you which options a particular command can take, and how each option modifies the behaviour of the command. Type man command to read the manual page for a particular command.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to find out more about the wc (word count) command, type\n",
    "\n",
    "% man wc\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively\n",
    "\n",
    "% whatis wc\n",
    "\n",
    "gives a one-line description of the command, but omits any information about options etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apropos\n",
    "When you are not sure of the exact name of a command,\n",
    "\n",
    "% apropos keyword\n",
    "\n",
    "will give you the commands with keyword in their manual page header. For example, try typing\n",

    "r allows users to list files in the directory;\n",
    "w means that users may delete files from the directory or move files into it;\n",
    "x means the right to access files in the directory. This implies that you may read files in the directory provided you have read permission on the individual files.\n",
    "So, in order to read a file, you must have execute permission on the directory containing that file, and hence on any directory containing that directory as a subdirectory, and so on, up the tree.\n",
